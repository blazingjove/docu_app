Goal for this project is to develop a react app that will compare a PDF file and excel file to see
if the dates are matching for each item.

the problem I am attempting to solve is to avoiding different dates in two databases that have no direct line
of communication, so I must compare the outputs of those databases and manually correct any discrepancies.

Items to accomplish
    - configure the webpage to accept an excel and PDF, through user upload
    - write the algorithim that will compare the dates of associated matching serial numbers in each document
    - output a file(leaning towards a .CSV file) with the different serial numbers and dates
